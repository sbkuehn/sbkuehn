My name is Shannon Eldridge-Kuehn (pronounced "Keen"). I am a not-so-typical technologist, as my roots are grounded in public speaking and writing. I was a Communication Studies major and English minor in college (University of Nebraska Lincoln graduate - Go Big Red!). Prior to collegiate life, I participated in competitive high school speech tournaments, so speaking in front of large audiences is something I've been doing most of my life.

You might be wondering how I even became technical. I gravitated toward technology through music, by way of being a DJ and needing to record demos for club promoters. As I took the initial time to develop troubleshooting skills, I quickly found myself in jobs that started to push me toward deeper levels of technical skill. A self-described tinkerer, I worked with technical mentors and colleagues who helped me develop proficiencies in infrastructure. From my initial roots in help desk, to Windows systems administration, to VMware administration, to Exchange, to Exchange Online/Office 365, and finally Azure, I carefully combined the right levels of technical prowess to propel me into into my current role at AHEAD as a Principal Solutions Architect. Prior to AHEAD, I worked at Microsoft. Before Microsoft, I worked at 10th Magnitude, and it was there that my love of cloud fully blossomed. Before 10th Magnitude, I held various "traditional" IT roles that focused inside the on-premises ecosystem.
