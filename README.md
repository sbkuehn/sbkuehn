My name is Shannon Kuehn (pronounced "Keen"). I am a not-so-typical technologist, as my roots are grounded in public speaking and writing. I was a Communication Studies major and English minor in college (University of Nebraska at Lincoln graduate - Go Big Red!). Prior to collegiate life, I participated in competitive high school speech tournaments, so speaking in front of large audiences is something I've been doing for most of my life.

You might be wondering how I even became technical. I gravitated toward technology through music, by way of being a DJ and needing to record demos for club promoters. As I took the initial time to develop troubleshooting skills, I quickly found myself in jobs that started to push me toward deeper levels of technical skill. A self-described tinkerer, I worked with technical mentors and colleagues who helped me develop proficiencies in infrastructure. From my initial roots in help desk, to Windows systems administration, to VMware administration, to Exchange, to Exchange Online/Office 365, and finally Azure, I carefully combined the right levels of technical prowess to propel me into into my first role at Microsoft. In the last 4 years, these are the roles I've held:
<br>
<br>Senior Cloud Solution Architect; National Accounts (January 2018 - March 2020)
<br>Senior Cloud Advocate; Enterprise Platforms and Tools - focus on Azure VMware Solution (March 2020 - November 2021)
<br>Senior Program Manager; Identity and Network Access Advocacy - focus on identity and security (November 2021 - Present)
<br><br>
In my day-to-day, I create content (videos, blogs, live streams) and conduct community outreach for Microsoft's SCIM toolsets as a way of helping both developers and IT pros feel comfortable within Microsoft's cloud platform.
